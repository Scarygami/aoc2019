Takes a couple of minutes to complete, so there is definitely room for improvement by narrowing down the search space.
I also do a full BFS for each key found, so there are definitely repetitive results that could be cached and reused as well.

For now I'm happy that my initial idea worked out and that I was able to complete part 2 with only minor changes,
and now changes at all to my main search procedure.
