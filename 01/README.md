The IntCode implementation of Part 1 can be started using my interpreter with run_ic01.py

If you run it on your own interpreter please be aware that there needs to be a final input value of 0
for the program to know when to stop adding up masses.

You can use the ic_compiler.py to translate my syntax of IntCode-Assembler Language (01_part1.icasm) to pure Intcode.
